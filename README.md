# Rock vs Mine Classification Model

This repository contains a machine learning classification model that distinguishes between **rock** and **mine** objects using sonar signal data. This is a classic binary classification problem solved using supervised learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The model is trained on the [Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs.+rocks), where each data point represents sonar returns bouncing off a metal cylinder (mine) or a rock at various angles. The objective is to accurately classify these objects.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features:** 60 numerical features representing sonar signals
- **Labels:** 'R' (Rock) and 'M' (Mine)

## ðŸ§  Model Summary

- Preprocessing: Standardization of features
- Algorithm:  LightGBM Classifier
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- **Accuracy:** ~`88%` _(replace with your model's accuracy)_
- **Precision/Recall/F1-score:** Reported in the final evaluation
